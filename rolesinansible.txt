Roles in ansible
======================
Role allows us to configure group of nodes
and also make our code modulear so it 
can be resued on many nodes

Apache--role for apache
what ever is required for apache2 should be present
in the role

ansible-galaxy init apache --offline

Components of a role
1 defaults-stores data about the role/application.
           default variables 

2 files- files to be copied to remote machines
3 handlers- tasks which are based on some actions.triggers
        in case my httpd.conf changes,it should trigger
        service restart.
4 meta-information about the role
       authotname,supported platfroms,dependencies etc
5 taskd-actula actions will be stored in tasks folder
         core logic..like installing packages,copying files
6 templates- for storing dynamic files...templates
           created using jinja2 template language
7 vars-both vars and defaults store variables but variables
      stored under vars have higher priority and are difficult 
      to overwrite.
